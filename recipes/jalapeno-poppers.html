    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jalapeños Peppers stuffed with cheese and bacon make a great appetizer for a crowd! They're easy to prep ahead and then throw a batch in the oven when people get hungry.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul class="list third">
        <li>12 jalapeño peppers</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped cooked bacon</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded jack cheese</li>
        <li>2 ounces jack cheese cut into 2 1/2-inch long strips</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol class="list first">
        <li>Preheat oven to 375&deg;F</li>
        <li>You can either slice the jalapeños in half lengthwise or you can slice off the top one-third (lengthwise) of each jalapeño to make a boat shape out of each pepper. The halved jalapeños will go further (twice as many stuffed peppers), but you can put more filling into the boat-shaped peppers. Your choice. If you choose to make the boats, you can mince the tops and add them to the filling if you want some extra heat, or save them for another recipe. In either case, scrape out all the seeds and ribs from each jalapeño with a spoon (a grapefruit spoon works great).</li>
        <li>Mix together all the filling ingredients except the jack cheese strips.</li>
        <li>Pack the filling into the peppers and nestle a strip of jack cheese onto the filling of each one.</li>
        <li>Arrange the peppers on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake at 375&deg;F for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned, and the peppers are cooked. Cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
